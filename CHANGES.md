# Changes Made to Portfolio Application

## Summary
Updated the portfolio application to use actual assets (profile picture and resume PDF) from the `/src/assets` directory instead of placeholder values.

## Files Modified

### 1. `/src/vite-end.d.ts`
**Purpose**: Added TypeScript type declarations for asset imports

**Changes**:
- Added module declarations for `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.JPG`, and `.pdf` file extensions
- This allows TypeScript to properly recognize imported assets as strings (file paths)

### 2. `/src/lib/initialData.ts`
**Purpose**: Updated to use the actual profile picture

**Changes**:
- Added import for the profile picture: `import profilePhoto from '@/assets/images/PHOTO-PS-MD_ABDULLAH_FARUQUE.JPG'`
- Updated `photoUrl` field from hardcoded string to use the imported `profilePhoto` variable
- This ensures the profile picture from assets is used throughout the application

### 3. `/src/pages/Home.tsx`
**Purpose**: Updated resume download functionality

**Changes**:
- Added import for the resume PDF: `import resumePDF from '@/assets/documents/CV_Zahid_6_year.pdf'`
- Removed `onDownloadPDF` from the component props interface
- Created new `handleDownloadResume` function that:
  - Creates a temporary anchor element
  - Sets the href to the imported resume PDF
  - Sets the download attribute to the desired filename
  - Programmatically clicks the link to trigger download
  - Shows a success toast notification
- Updated the download button to use `handleDownloadResume` instead of `onDownloadPDF`

### 4. `/src/App.tsx`
**Purpose**: Removed obsolete PDF handling function

**Changes**:
- Removed `handleDownloadPDF` function (which previously used `window.print()`)
- Removed `onDownloadPDF` prop from the `<Home>` component in the route definition
- Download functionality is now self-contained within the Home component

## Assets Used

### Profile Picture
- **Location**: `/src/assets/images/zahid_passport_photo.png`
- **Used in**: Avatar components throughout the application
- **Format**: JPG image

### Resume PDF
- **Location**: `/src/assets/documents/CV_Zahid_6_year.pdf`
- **Used in**: Download Resume button on the homepage
- **Format**: PDF document
- **Download name**: `MdAbdullahFaruque_Resume.pdf`

## Behavior Changes

### Before
- Profile picture was referenced by a string path that may not have existed
- "Download Resume" button triggered the browser's print dialog

### After
- Profile picture is imported as a module and properly bundled by Vite
- "Download Resume" button downloads the actual PDF file from assets
- Users get the real resume PDF file with proper filename
- Toast notification confirms successful download

## Technical Notes

1. **Asset Import Pattern**: Using ES module imports for assets ensures they are:
   - Properly processed by Vite's build system
   - Given cache-busting hashes in production builds
   - Optimized and included in the bundle

2. **Type Safety**: TypeScript declarations ensure type checking works correctly for all asset imports

3. **User Experience**: Direct PDF download is more intuitive than print dialog for resume downloads
