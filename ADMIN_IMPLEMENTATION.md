# Admin Dashboard - Complete Implementation Guide

## 🎯 Overview

The portfolio now features a comprehensive Admin Dashboard with full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) capabilities for **all content** including profile pictures, personal information, experiences, projects, skills, education, certifications, statistics, and highlights.

## 🔐 Security Implementation

### Password Hashing & Storage
- Admin credentials are hashed using Web Crypto API (SHA-256)
- Hashed passwords stored securely in `spark.kv` storage
- Password verification compares hashes, never plaintext
- Session-based authentication with `sessionStorage`

### Default Admin Credentials
**Email:** `admin@zahid.com`  
**Password:** `Admin@123`

**To change credentials:** Modify the `initializeAdminCredentials` function in `src/lib/auth.ts`
